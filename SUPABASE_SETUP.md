# Supabase Configuration for Testing

## Disable Email Confirmation (Recommended for Development)

By default, Supabase requires email confirmation for new users. For easier testing during development, you can disable this:

### Steps to Disable Email Confirmation:

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
   - Navigate to your project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)

2. **Open Authentication Settings**
   - Click on "Authentication" in the left sidebar
   - Click on "Settings" 

3. **Disable Email Confirmation**
   - Find the "User Signups" section
   - **Uncheck** "Enable email confirmations"
   - Click "Save"

### Alternative: Enable Email Confirmation

If you want to keep email confirmation enabled (recommended for production):

1. **Configure Email Templates** (optional):
   - Go to Authentication > Email Templates
   - Customize the confirmation email template

2. **Test Email Confirmation Flow**:
   - Use a real email address when signing up
   - Check your email for the confirmation link
   - Click the confirmation link
   - Then try signing in with the same credentials

### Current App Behavior:

- **With Email Confirmation Disabled**: Sign up will immediately sign in the user
- **With Email Confirmation Enabled**: Sign up shows success message, user must verify email before signing in

### Testing Recommendations:

1. **For Development**: Disable email confirmation for faster testing
2. **For Production**: Enable email confirmation for security
3. **Test Both Flows**: Ensure your app works in both scenarios

### Sign-up Success Detection:

The app now correctly detects sign-up success in both cases:
- ✅ **Immediate sign-in** (email confirmation disabled)
- ✅ **Email verification required** (email confirmation enabled)

Both scenarios will show appropriate success messages to the user.
